The Botany WebApp is a web application developed as a final project for a programming course. The project aims to provide an interactive platform related to botany. The application features three main functionalities.

The first functionality allows users to purchase botany-related products. Users can browse the product catalog, add items to the cart, and proceed with checkout.

The second functionality is the Daily Challenge, where users are presented with an image related to botany and challenged to guess its name. Each day features a new image, enabling users to test their knowledge and track their progress.

The third functionality is the blog section, where users can upload their own botany-related photos and receive comments from other users. This section fosters a community around the shared passion for botany, providing a platform for learning, inspiration, and connection.

The Botany WebApp was developed using the ASP.NET MVC framework in C#, along with front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I tried to create a python application to handle checkout queues but I couldn't finish. The purpose of the application was after the queue, an email was sent to the carrier.

The application was version-controlled on GitHub for versioning and collaboration. The project was also implemented with a scalable and modular architecture, following best practices in web development. A pipeline was created in devops for CI/CD.

This project was ambitious and I went through several difficulties, but I came out better prepared for the real world. Hope you like the final result.
